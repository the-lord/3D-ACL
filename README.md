##Another Custom Leg



Given the need to put a shelf on my desk, I designed this leg.

I tried to make it configurable to suit other needs.



### Global variables

```
h = 90;  //height

w = 40;  //width

d = 40;  //depth

t = 4;   //thickness

f = 20;  //flap

```



### Modules

leg();



xflap(reinforcement=true,m=2);



yflap(reinforcement=true,m=2);
